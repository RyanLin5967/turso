# PRE-REGISTRATION — `branch_curve` (Turso fork, per-branch CoW arena)

Written and committed BEFORE the benchmark's first run — before its first BUILD, in fact: the
harness was written under the no-local-compute rule (2026-09-24) and committed UNBUILT. The
mechanism it measures is `caeb8d71c` (`ferrobranch-arena`; later commits there add tests only).
Amendments are append-only, dated, below the line at the end. Nothing above that line changes
after the first run. A compile fix to the harness is an amendment only if it changes what is
timed or asserted; the diff must say which.

## What is measured

`core/examples/branch_curve/main.rs`. One process, one thread, one trunk table of 20,000 rows
(100-byte values, checkpointed into the database file before any fork). The harness grows N live
branches forked from the trunk, each of which rewrites ONE row in place (same length) and so owns
ONE page. At each checkpoint N it takes K samples (default 200) of:

| op | what is timed |
|---|---|
| `fork` | `trunk.fork_branch()` |
| `open` | `branch.connect()` on the branch just forked |
| `first_write` | one autocommit `UPDATE` of one row on that branch |
| `read_open` | `branch.connect()` on a random one of the N live branches |
| `read_own` | `SELECT` of the row that branch wrote (its leaf is in the arena) |
| `read_inh` | `SELECT` of a far row it did not write (its leaf is the trunk's) |
| `reap` | `Branch::reap()` of a sampled branch |

Instrument: `std::time::Instant` per operation; the harness prints the clock's measured tick. RSS
from `memory_stats::physical_mem`. Before printing any number at a checkpoint the harness asserts
FROM THE ENGINE that `live_branches == N` and `arena_slots_in_use == N`, spot-checks isolation on
a random branch, and after sampling asserts it is back at exactly N; otherwise it prints
`NOT A RESULT` and exits 1.

The lead runs everything, in a release build under the machine lock: first a smoke at
N ≤ 10³ (default arguments), then the full curve (N = 10², 10³, 10⁴, 10⁵, 10⁶). The smoke is NOT
a slope result (two points, K = 200) and is labelled as such; it exists to show the harness's
own assertions pass before the long run is spent.

## Predictions, from the design (READ from `core/branch/store.rs`, not measured)

The mechanism's per-operation work, as the code reads:

* `fork` — trunk WAL read+write lock round trip, page-1 header read (cached), one `HashMap` insert
  (branches), one `BTreeMap` insert (trunk children). O(log N).
* `open` — a new `Pager` (`Database::_init`: 512-byte header read, WAL read-tx round trip), an
  `Arc<Schema>` clone, a `Connection`. No term in N.
* `first_write` — resolve root + leaf (branch map miss, one level up to the trunk: hash lookups),
  WAL read of those pages, CoW: one slot allocation + one 4 KiB copy, commit: one 4 KiB copy.
  No term in N except the arena growing (fresh slots are fresh, untouched memory).
* `read_own` / `read_inh` — resolve a 2–3 page descent through hash lookups; the owned leaf is a
  random slot in an N-page arena.
* `reap` — `HashMap` remove, `BTreeMap` remove, a neighbour lookup and an (empty) range query in
  the trunk's retained index. O(log N).

**P1 (slopes).** For every op, the least-squares log-log slope of p50 against N over
10² … 10⁶ is **within ±0.10** — i.e. flat. O(log N) terms are too small to show over a 10⁴×
range at these constants.

**P2 (memory-hierarchy step, the expected deviation).** `read_own` may step UP between 10³ and
10⁵ as the arena (4 KiB × N) outgrows the CPU caches and the owned leaf becomes a cold, random
page — a bounded step, **at most 2×** p50 from 10³ to 10⁶, not a slope. `read_inh` should not
step (its leaf is one of the trunk's ~600 pages, hot in every branch's reads).

**P3 (tails).** p99/max of `fork` will show isolated spikes at the `HashMap` doublings of the
branch table (power-of-two N); a spike is a single sample and is not a slope. No claim on max.

**P4 (space).** Exactly **1 arena page per live branch** (`arena_slots_in_use == N`, asserted),
i.e. `page_size` bytes of page data per branch. RSS per branch at 10⁶ between **4.1 and 5.5 KB**
(page + map entries + handle), measured as total RSS / N (includes the fixed base; the base is
printed).

**P5 (reclamation).** After teardown, 0 live branches and 0 arena pages in use (asserted).

## Falsifiers — what each outcome would mean

* Any op with |p50 slope| ≥ **0.25** over 10²…10⁶: a wall. It must be attributed (profile or an
  arm with the suspected term removed) before any mechanism is named; per the project's rule, no
  mechanism is stated for a gap until it is itself checked.
* 0.10 < |slope| < 0.25: inconclusive at K = 200; re-run with larger K and a Latin-square order
  before reading anything into it.
* `arena_slots_in_use != N`: the "one page per branch" premise is false for this UPDATE on
  Turso (e.g. a rebalance on same-length rewrite) — the harness refuses, and the premise is
  re-derived from the engine before the curve means anything.
* `read_own` step > 2×: the arena's layout (one slot per branch, allocation order) is a locality
  wall worth its own row.

## Known limits of this measurement, stated before it runs

* The arena is **volatile** (no persisted branch map). ferrodb D79 measured that persisting the
  map was the wall there; this curve deliberately measures branch management WITHOUT that, and
  must be compared only with ferrodb's persistence-OFF arm.
* Single-threaded: the store's single `Mutex` is not exercised under contention.
* Depth 1: every branch forks from the trunk. Resolution cost grows with depth, not N; depth is
  not on this curve's axis.
* The trunk does not write during the curve, so no retained versions exist; the GC range query is
  exercised only in its empty case.
