//! Per-branch page spaces, and the rule that decides which version of a page a branch sees.
//!
//! # The model
//!
//! Every node in the branch tree — the trunk and each branch — carries an `epoch` that its own
//! forks advance: a child forked from a node records the node's epoch at that moment as its
//! `fork_epoch`, and the node's epoch then increments. A version of a page that a node wrote in
//! epoch `born` is visible to that node's children forked at any epoch `>= born`, until the node
//! overwrites it in epoch `died`; after that it is visible only to children forked in
//! `[born, died)`. A branch therefore sees, for each page:
//!
//! 1. its own current version, if it has written the page; else
//! 2. its parent's version at the branch's `fork_epoch` — the parent's current version if it was
//!    born at or before that epoch, else the parent's RETAINED version covering it; else
//! 3. the same question one level up, down to the trunk, whose current version lives in the WAL
//!    and the database file and is read by the ordinary pager path.
//!
//! # Resolution without the walk — the page map
//!
//! Steps 2 and 3 are answered for every level between a branch and the trunk at once, and frozen,
//! at the moment the branch forks: nothing a branch sees through its ancestors can change after its
//! fork (an ancestor's later write retains the version the branch saw, in the same slot). So each
//! branch carries `inherited`, a persistent [`PageMap`] of every arena page it sees through its
//! ancestors, which is its parent's `view` at the fork: the parent's own `inherited` plus the
//! parent's current pages, kept up to date by the parent's writes once it has forked a child. A
//! fork clones the parent's `view` in O(1) and a write path-copies O(log P) trie nodes, so a
//! lookup costs the same at depth 1000 as at depth 1. A page no branch in the chain wrote is the
//! trunk's, as of `trunk_at`, the fork epoch at which the branch's ancestry leaves the trunk.
//!
//! # Where the copies come from — the write ticket
//!
//! A version is retained, or a branch gets its own copy, at exactly one moment: the first
//! [`crate::storage::pager::Pager::add_dirty`] of a page in a transaction, which is also the only
//! place a [`crate::storage::pager::WriteTicket`] can be minted. So every page write is preceded by
//! the copy decision by construction:
//!
//! * a **branch** writing a page it does not yet own copies the page into a fresh slot of its own
//!   page space; writing a page it owns while a live child can still see the current version moves
//!   that version to the retained set and copies into a fresh slot;
//! * the **trunk** writing a page that a live child can still see copies the pre-image into a slot
//!   and retains it, before the write reaches the WAL — so neither the commit nor a later
//!   checkpoint that moves the new version into the database file can reach the child.
//!
//! # Reclamation
//!
//! A retained version is garbage once no live child of its node forked inside `[born, died)`.
//! Removing the child forked at `f` can only make versions containing `f` garbage, and a version
//! containing `f` becomes garbage exactly when it also lies strictly between `f`'s neighbouring
//! live siblings `lo` and `hi`: `born > lo` and `died <= hi`. The versions are indexed both by
//! `born` and by `died` — ZFS's deadlists, which key a dead block by the interval that killed it
//! and split it by birth — so that each side of that query is a range, not a scan:
//!
//! * with no older live sibling (the oldest child, which is whom uniform-TTL lease expiry reaps),
//!   the garbage is exactly the versions with `died` in `(f, hi]`;
//! * with no younger one (the newest child), exactly those with `born` in `(lo, f]`;
//! * with both, each range also holds survivors, and the two are walked in lockstep until the
//!   shorter one ends (see [`Lineage::garbage`]).
//!
//! A branch whose handle has been dropped but that still has a live child or an open connection
//! is kept (its versions are still read through); it is freed the moment the last of those goes,
//! and freeing it may in turn free its parent.
//!
//! # What this does not do
//!
//! * One `Mutex` guards every branch. Correct, and a known wall under concurrent writers on
//!   different branches; the benchmark this lane ships is single-threaded and says so.
//! * The persistent page maps are an index over slots the lineages own; they own nothing. A
//!   branch's `inherited` names only slots its ancestors keep for it (see "Resolution without the
//!   walk"), so dropping a map never frees a page and keeping one never pins a page.
//!
//! # Per-page version order (the fat node)
//!
//! Within one node, one page's retained versions have non-empty, pairwise disjoint `[born, died)`
//! ranges: the trunk retains `[written, epoch)` and then sets `written = epoch`, and a branch
//! retains `[owned.born, epoch)` and re-bears its current version at `epoch`. So `born` is unique
//! per (node, page), and the version a child forked at `f` sees is the one with the greatest
//! `born <= f`, provided `f < died`. The versions are kept in a map ordered by `born`, which makes
//! that lookup a predecessor search and a release a removal by key — Driscoll, Sarnak, Sleator and
//! Tarjan's fat node (JCSS 1989) with a search tree over its version stamps. [`Lineage::retain`]
//! refuses a version that would break the disjointness the search relies on.
