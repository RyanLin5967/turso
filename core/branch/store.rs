//! Per-branch page spaces, the rule that decides which version of a page a branch sees, and — for
//! durable branches — how that state is logged and recovered. ⚠ The durability half is UNBUILT.
//!
//! # The model
//!
//! Every node in the branch tree — the trunk and each branch — carries an `epoch` that its own
//! forks advance: a child forked from a node records the node's epoch at that moment as its
//! `fork_epoch`, and the node's epoch then increments. A version of a page that a node wrote in
//! epoch `born` is visible to that node's children forked at any epoch `>= born`, until the node
//! overwrites it in epoch `died`; after that it is visible only to children forked in
//! `[born, died)`. A branch therefore sees, for each page:
//!
//! 1. its own current version, if it has written the page; else
//! 2. its parent's version at the branch's `fork_epoch` — the parent's current version if it was
//!    born at or before that epoch, else the parent's RETAINED version covering it; else
//! 3. the same question one level up, down to the trunk, whose current version lives in the WAL
//!    and the database file and is read by the ordinary pager path.
//!
//! # Where the copies come from — the write ticket
//!
//! Every copy decision is taken at the first [`crate::storage::pager::Pager::add_dirty`] of a
//! page in a transaction, the only place a [`crate::storage::pager::WriteTicket`] is minted:
//!
//! * on a **branch**, the decision reserves a FRESH slot in the branch's own page space. The commit
//!   writes the page into it and only then moves the branch's map to it (shadow paging, as LMDB and
//!   WAFL do): the version it replaces is retained if a live child forked while it was current,
//!   else freed. A rolled-back transaction returns its reservations.
//! * on the **trunk**, a page a live child can still see has its pre-image copied into a slot and
//!   retained before the write, so neither the trunk's commit nor a later checkpoint that moves
//!   the new version into the database file can reach the child.
//!
//! # Reclamation
//!
//! A retained version is garbage once no live child of its node forked inside `[born, died)`.
//! Removing the child forked at `f` can only make versions containing `f` garbage, and a version
//! containing `f` becomes garbage exactly when it also lies strictly between `f`'s neighbouring
//! live siblings — which is a range query over `retained_by_born`, not a scan.
//!
//! A released branch that still has a live child or an open connection is kept (its versions are
//! still read through); it is freed the moment the last of those goes, and freeing it may in turn
//! free its parent.
//!
//! # Durability (see `journal.rs` for the files and their prior art)
//!
//! Durable branches log OPERATIONS — `Fork`, `Commit`, `TrunkRetain`, `Release` — and recover by
//! replaying them through the same `apply_*` functions the live store runs, so epochs, children and
//! every branch-side retain/free decision are re-derived rather than stored. Two rules:
//!
//! 1. A record is written only after every slot it names is durable (the journal's flush order),
//!    and an operation that returns to its caller has had its record flushed.
//! 2. A slot is freed only after the record that frees it is durable: an older durable state that
//!    still names it can never see it reused.
//!
//! The trunk's `written` epochs are NOT persisted. At recovery each is rebuilt as the largest
//! `died` among the trunk's retained versions of that page. That can only UNDER-state the true
//! last-write epoch, and only for writes that retained nothing — writes made when no live child
//! had forked inside the interval. Forks only take later epochs, so no child that could need the
//! understated interval can ever exist, and every retention the lower bound later triggers covers
//! only children that see the trunk's current version, which is exactly what it copies.
//!
//! # What this does not do
//!
//! * One `Mutex` guards every branch, held across the durable store's fsyncs. Correct, and a named
//!   wall under concurrent writers; the benchmark this lane ships is single-threaded and says so.
//! * Resolution walks the ancestor chain: cost grows with DEPTH, not with the number of branches.
//! * Recovery is eager: every branch map is materialised at open, O(live branch state).
